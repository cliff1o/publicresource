Sky_World - is a world after thausands of years, when mankind vanished... Gravity on earth became lower thanks to which this map formated. Those floating blocks are only mementos of mankind.

This map wass being made about 2 months. It had to be my last momento for you about me. But, thanks to you, you showed me, that I am not forgotten. Also, you gave me a lot of hope to continue my mapping career. Therefore this map won't be called a "goodbye" map, but as a "rebirth" map.

Thanks to:

Huge thank you for GetHIX, who helped me a lot with this map. He improved the sky for me, fixed "Random Teleport" and much more. Thank you a lot GetHIX.
Moreover, i would like to give thanks for all the people, who helped me to test this map. I won't write their names, because there were a lot of them.

It is best to play this map for "CSDM" and "GunGame" mods and maybe for "HNS" mod.
